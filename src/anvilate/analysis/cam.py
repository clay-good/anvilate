"""T1 analytical cam-follower motion profiles (closed-form kinematics).

A cam turns rotation into a programmed follower motion, and the *profile* — how
the lift is distributed across the cam angle — decides how violently. The lift L
and rise angle β are fixed by the job; the profile is the designer's choice, and
it lives or dies on its acceleration, because acceleration times follower mass is
the force that hammers the contact and shakes the machine.

Two classic rise profiles bracket the trade-off. Simple harmonic motion (SHM)
lays the lift on a cosine,

    y = (L/2)·(1 − cos(π·θ/β)),

which is smooth in velocity but starts and ends with a *finite* acceleration —
an abrupt jerk step that a high-speed cam feels as a knock. Cycloidal motion,

    y = L·(θ/β − sin(2π·θ/β)/(2π)),

instead brings acceleration smoothly to zero at both ends, so it mates to a dwell
without a jump; it pays with a higher peak acceleration in the middle. Between them
sits parabolic (constant-acceleration) motion, which accelerates at a constant
+4L/β² for the first half of the rise and −4L/β² for the second — the *lowest*
possible peak acceleration for a given lift and rise, but with abrupt jerk steps
where the acceleration jumps. Velocity and acceleration follow by differentiating
with respect to time, which brings down one and two factors of the cam speed ω
(v = ẏ = (dy/dθ)·ω, a = (d²y/dθ²)·ω²).

The cam angle θ and rise angle β are plain-float degrees (the units layer carries
no angle); the lift is a length and the cam speed a rotational frequency —
dimension-checked :class:`~anvilate.units.Quantity` values.
